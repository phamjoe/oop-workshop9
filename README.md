# Workshop 9


In this workshop, you are to create an abstract base class and inherit it into two derived classes.

This workshop demonstrates:
- Usage of a virtual base class
- inheritance from a virtual base class
-	Call derived class functions through a virtual base class call, demonstrating inclusion polymorphism

# Sample output
This motorbike is going <speed> after acceleration and braking and <has a sidecar / does not have a sidecar> (depends on the value of the motorbikeâ€™s Boolean).
